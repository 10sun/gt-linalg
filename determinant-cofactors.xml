  <title>Cofactor expansions </title>



  <p>
    We now give another description of the determinant which is often useful in computations.
  </p>

  <p>This is called the <em>cofactor expansion</em>  of a matrix, and computes the determinant from the ground up via a recursive procedure. Namely, this method will show how to compute the determinant for <m>n\times n</m> matrices, <em>assuming</em> we already know how to do so for <m>(n-1)\times(n-1)</m> matrices.
  </p>

  <p>Let's start at the beginning. First, we consider the case of <m>1\times1</m> matrices. The definition of determinant directly implies that
  <me>\det\mat a=a.</me>
  To describe cofactor expansions, we first need to introduce a little notation.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="Minor-Cofactors-Defn">
    <statement>
      <p>Suppose that <m>A</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>.
      </p>

      <p>The <m>(i,j)</m>-th <term>minor,</term> denoted <m>A_{ij}</m>, is the <m>(n-1)\times (n-1)</m> matrix obtained from <m>A</m> by deleting the <m>i</m>-th row and the <m>j</m>-th column.</p>

      <p>The <m>(i,j)</m>-th <term>cofactor </term>  <m>\ C_{ij}</m> is defined in terms of the minor by
      <me>C_{ij}=(-1)^{i+j}\det A_{ij}.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
  Note that the signs of the cofactors follow a "checkerboard pattern". Namely, the pattern of plus and minus signs in the <m>(i,j)</m>-th entry of the matrix
  <me>\def\a{\textcolor{seq-green}{+}} \def\b{\textcolor{seq-blue}{-}}
\mat{\a,\b,\a,\b ; \b,\a,\b,\a ; \a,\b,\a,\b; \b,\a,\b,\a}</me>
  is the sign in the definition of <m>C_{ij}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using <xref ref="Minor-Cofactors-Defn"/>, we can describe our procedure for computing determinants as follows.
  </p>

  <algorithm>
    <title>Cofactor/Laplace expansion</title>
    <p>
      To compute the determinant of a square matrix, do the following.
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Choose any row or column of <m>A</m>.
	</li>
	<li> For each element <m>a_{ij}</m> of this row or column, compute the associated cofactor <m>C_{ij}</m>.</li>
	<li>
	  Multiply each cofactor by the associated matrix entry <m>a_{ij}</m>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <alert>Result:</alert>  The sum of these products is <m>\det A</m>.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </algorithm>

  <p>
    In formulas, this says that if we pick row <m>i</m> to "expand along," then the cofactor expansion formula is
    <me>\det A=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}C_{ij},</me>
    where in the sum the number <m>i</m> is fixed. Similarly, if we pick column <m>j</m> to expand along, then we obtain a formula
    <me>\det A=\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij}C_{ij}.</me>
    Note that this gives <m>2n</m> seemingly-different formulas, which all give the same number! We will see why this is true later, and simply assume this for now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's try this out for a general <m>2\times2</m> matrix <m>A=\mat{a b;c d}</m>.     The minors are computed as follows:

  <p>
    They are all just single-entry matrices. As we have seen that the determinant of a <m>1\times1</m> matrix is just the number inside of it, the cofactors are therefore
    <md>
      <mrow>C_{11} &amp;= {+\det A_{11} = d} &amp;
      C_{12} &amp;= {-\det A_{12} = -c}</mrow>
      <mrow>C_{21} &amp;= {-\det A_{21} = -b} &amp;
      C_{22} &amp;= {+\det A_{22} = a}</mrow>
    </md>
    Choosing the first row of <m>A</m> in Step 1 of the cofactor expansion algorithm (when we do this, we also say that we are <em>expanding the determinant along the first row</em>), we find that
    <me>\det A=aC_{11}+bC_{12} = ad - bc,</me>
    which is a useful formula you may have seen before

    In the next example, we use cofactor expansion find a formula for the determinant of any <m>3\times 3</m> matrix.

      <p>We find the determinant of
      <me>A = \mat{a_{11} a_{12} a_{13}; a_{21} a_{22} a_{23}; a_{31} a_{32} a_{33}}</me>
      by expanding along the first row.  The minors and cofactors are computed as follows:

        The determinant is:

          </mrow>
        </md>
        which (magically) is the same formula as before.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    Here we perform the computation for a particular matrix.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>We find the determinant of
      <me>A= \mat{2 1 3;-1 2 1;-2 2 3}.</me>
      We make the somewhat arbitrary choice to expand along the first row. We compute the minors as
      <me> A_{11} = \mat{2 1;2 3} \quad\quad A_{12}=\mat{-1 1;2 3} \quad\quad  A_{13}=\mat{-1 2;-2 2}.</me>
      Computing these <m>2\times 2</m> determinants, we have
      <me>\det A_{11}=4,\quad\quad \det A_{12}=-1,\quad\quad \det A_{13}=2.</me>
      By inserting signs, we find that the cofactors are
      <me>C_{11}=\det A_{11}=4,\quad\quad C_{12}=-\det A_{12}=1,\quad\quad C_{13}=\det A_{13}=2.</me>
      Thus,
      <me>\det A=a_{11}C_{11}+a_{12}C_{12}+a_{13}C_{13} =2(4)+(1)+3(2)=15.</me>
    </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    With this method, much larger determinants are also easy to compute, especially when there are lots of zeros in a row or column. Generally speaking, it is a good idea when computing an example to try to expand along a row or column with as many zeros as possible, or at least with the smallest entries possible.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>We find the determinant of
      <me>A= \mat{2 5 -3 -2;-2 -3 2 -5;1 3 -2 0;-1 6 4 0}.</me>
      We expand along the last column to find
      <me>\det A=2\det\mat{-2 -3 2;1 3 -2;-1 6 4}
      -5 \det \mat{2 5 -3;1 3 -2;-1 6 4}.</me>
      We can find these two determinants by expanding them as well. For example, expanding along the first column on the first one, we find that
      <md>
        <mrow>
          &amp; \det \mat{-2 -3 2;1 3 -2;-1 6 4}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          &amp; = -2 \det \mat{3 -2;6 4} -\det \mat{-3 2;6 4} -\det \mat{-3 2;3 -2}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          &amp; = -2 (24) -(-24) -0=-48+24+0=-24.
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Similarly, by expanding the second <m>3\times 3</m> matrix along the first column, we find that
      <md>
        <mrow>
        &amp;
        \mat{2 5 -3;1 3 -2;-1 6 4}
        = 2 \det \mat{3 -2;6 4} -\det \mat{5 -3;6 4} -\det \mat{5 -3;3 -2}
        </mrow><mrow>
        &amp; = 2(24) -(38) -(-1) = 11.
      </mrow>
      </md>
      Thus, we find that
      <me>\det A= 2(-24)-5(11)=-103.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    Although this technique works reasonably quickly in most small examples, several questions come to mind.

    <ol>
      <li>
	Where do these formulas come from?
      </li>
      <li>
	How do we know that these numbers give the same answer <em>regardless</em> of which row or column we choose (that is, this method gives <m>2n</m> different expressions for the same number attached to an <m>n\times n</m> matrix, which we claim are always all equal).
      </li>
      <li>
	How do we know that this procedure gives the same number as in the definition of determinant by row reduction in the last section?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
	  For now, we don't have the tools to answer these questions. However, these "coincidences" show that the existence of a function like the determinant is surprising and very special.
