  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section we discuss <em>subspaces</em> of <m>\R^n</m>.  A subspace turns out to be exactly the same thing as a span, except we don't have a particular set of spanning vectors in mind.  This change in perspective is quite useful, as it is easy to produce subspaces which are not obviously spans.  For example, the solution set of the equation <m>x + 3y + z = 0</m> is a span because the equation is homogeneous, but we would have to compute the parametric vector form to find a spanning set of vectors.

    <title>Subspaces: Definition and Examples</title>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>A <term>subset</term> of <m>\R^n</m> is any collection of elements of <m>\R^n</m>.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For instance, the unit circle
      <me>C = \bigl\{ (x,y)\text{ in }\R^2 \bigm| x^2 + y^2 = 1 \bigr\}</me>
      is a subset of <m>\R^2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Above we expressed <m>C</m> in set builder notation, which we introduced in this <xref ref="set-builder-notation"/>.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>subspace</term> of <m>\R^n</m> is a subset <m>V</m> of <m>\R^n</m> satisfying:
          <ol>
            <li><em>Nonemptiness:</em> The zero vector is in <m>V</m>.</li>
            <li><em>Closure under addition:</em> If <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are in <m>V</m>, then <m>u+v</m> is also in <m>V</m>.</li>
            <li><em>Closure under scalar multiplication:</em> If <m>v</m> is in <m>V</m> and <m>c</m> is in <m>\R</m>, then <m>cv</m> is also in <m>V</m>.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>As a consequence of these properties, we see:
    <ul>
      <li>If <m>v</m> is a vector in <m>V</m>, then all scalar multiples of <m>v</m> are in <m>V</m> by the third property.  In other words, the line through <m>v</m> is also contained in <m>V</m>.</li>
      <li>If <m>u,v</m> are vectors in <m>V</m> and <m>x,y</m> are scalars, then <m>xu,yv</m> are also in <m>V</m> by the third property, so <m>xu+yv</m> is in <m>V</m> by the second property.  Therefore, all of <m>\Span\{u,v\}</m> is contained in <m>V</m></li>
      <li>Similarly, if <m>v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n</m> are all in <m>V</m>, then <m>\Span\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n\}</m> is contained in <m>V</m>.  In other words, <em>a subspace contains the span of any vectors in it.</em></li>
    </ul>
    If you choose enough vectors, then eventually their span will fill up <m>V</m>, so we already see that a <em>subspace is a span</em>.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>Suppose that <m>V</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>\R^n</m> that satisfies properties 2 and 3.  Let <m>v</m> be any vector in <m>V</m>.  Then <m>0v = 0</m> is in <m>V</m> by the third property, so <m>V</m> automatically satisfies property 1.  It follows that the only subset of <m>\R^n</m> that satisfies properties 2 and 3 but <em>not</em> property 1 is the empty subset <m>\{\}</m>.  This is why we call the first property <q>nonemptiness</q>.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <specialcase>
      <p>The set <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of itself: indeed, it contains zero, and is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.</p>
    </specialcase>

    <specialcase>
      <p>The set <m>\{0\}</m> containing only the zero vector is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>: it contains zero, and if you add zero to itself or multiply it by a scalar, you always get zero.</p>
    </specialcase>

      <title>Subsets versus Subspaces</title>
      <p>
        A <term>subset</term> of <m>\R^n</m> is any collection of vectors whatsoever.  For instance, the unit circle
        <me>C = \bigl\{ (x,y)\text{ in }\R^2 \bigm| x^2 + y^2 = 1 \bigr\}</me>
        is a subset of <m>\R^2</m>, but it is not a subspace.  In fact, all of the non-examples above are still subsets of <m>\R^n</m>.  A subspace is a subset that happens to satisfy the three additional defining properties.
      </p>
    </warning>

    <p>
      In order to verify that a subset of <m>\R^n</m> is in fact a subspace, one has to check the three defining properties.  That is, unless the subset has already been verified to be a subspace: see this <xref ref="subspaces-types-of"/> below.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="subspaces-eg-byhand">
      <title>Verifying that a subset is a subspace</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let
          <me> V = \left\{ \vec{a b} \text{ in } \R^2 \bigm| 2a = 3b\right\}.</me>
          Verify that <m>V</m> is a subspace.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First we point out that the condition <q><m>2a = 3b</m></q> defines whether or not a vector is in <m>V</m>: that is, to say <m>{a\choose b}</m> is in <m>V</m> <em>means</em> that <m>2a = 3b</m>.  In other words, a vector is in <m>V</m> if twice its first coordinate equals three times its second coordinate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let us check the first property.  The subset <m>V</m> does contain the zero vector <m>{0\choose 0}</m>, because <m>2\cdot 0 = 3\cdot 0</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next we check the second property.  To show that <m>V</m> is closed under addition, we have to check that for <em>any</em> vectors <m>u = {a\choose b}</m> and <m>v = {c\choose d}</m> in <m>V</m>, the sum <m>u+v</m> is in <m>V</m>.  Since we cannot assume anything else about <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>, we must treat them as <em>unknowns</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have
          <me>\vec{a b} + \vec{c d} = \vec{a+c b+d}.</me>
          To say that <m>a+c\choose b+d</m> is contained in <m>V</m> means that <m>2(a+c) = 3(b+d)</m>, or <m>2a + 2c = 3b + 3d</m>.  The one thing we are allowed to assume about <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is that <m>2a = 3b</m> and <m>2c = 3d</m>, so we see that <m>u+v</m> is indeed contained in <m>V</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next we check the third property.  To show that <m>V</m> is closed under scalar multiplication, we have to check that for any vector <m>v = {a\choose b}</m> in <m>V</m> and any scalar <m>c</m> in <m>\R</m>, the product <m>cv</m> is in <m>V</m>.  Again, we must treat <m>v</m> and <m>c</m> as unknowns.  We have
          <me>c\vec{a b} = \vec{ca cb}.</me>
          To say that <m>ca\choose cb</m> is contained in <m>V</m> means that <m>2(ca) = 3(cb)</m>, i.e., that <m>c\cdot 2a = c\cdot 3b</m>.  The one thing we are allowed to assume about <m>v</m> is that <m>2a = 3b</m>, so <m>cv</m> is indeed contained in <m>V</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since <m>V</m> satisfies all three defining properties, it is a subspace.
          In fact, it is the line through the origin with slope <m>2/3</m>.

      <title>Showing that a subset is not a subspace</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let
          <me>V = \left\{ \vec{a b} \text{ in } \R^2\bigm| ab=0 \right\}.</me>
          Is <m>V</m> a subspace?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First we point out that the condition <q><m>ab=0</m></q> defines whether or not a vector is in <m>V</m>: that is, to say <m>{a\choose b}</m> is in <m>V</m> <em>means</em> that <m>ab=0</m>.  In other words, a vector is in <m>V</m> if the product of its coordinates is zero, i.e., if one (or both) of its coordinates are zero.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let us check the first property.  The subset <m>V</m> does contain the zero vector <m>{0\choose 0}</m>, because <m>0\cdot 0=0</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next we check the third property.  To show that <m>V</m> is closed under scalar multiplication, we have to check that for <em>any</em> vector <m>v = {a\choose b}</m> in <m>V</m> and <em>any</em> scalar <m>c</m> in <m>\R</m>, the product <m>cv</m> is in <m>V</m>.  Since we cannot assume anything else about <m>v</m> and <m>c</m>, we must treat them as <em>unknowns</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have
          <me>c\vec{a b} = \vec{ca cb}.</me>
          To say that <m>ca\choose cb</m> is contained in <m>V</m> means that <m>(ca)(cb)=0</m>.  Rewriting, this means <m>c^2(ab)=0</m>.  The one thing we are allowed to assume about <m>v</m> is that <m>ab=0</m>, so we see that <m>cv</m> is indeed contained in <m>V</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next we check the second property.  It turns out that <m>V</m> is not closed under addition; to verify this, we must show that there exists <em>some</em> vectors <m>u,v</m> in <m>V</m> such that <m>u+v</m> is not contained in <m>V</m>.  The easiest way to do so is to produce examples of such vectors.  We can take <m>u={1\choose 0}</m> and <m>v={0\choose 1}</m>; these are contained in <m>V</m> because the products of their coordinates are zero, but
          <me>\vec{1 0} + \vec{0 1} = \vec{1 1}</me>
          is not contained in <m>V</m> because <m>1\cdot 1\neq 0</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since <m>V</m> does not satisfy the second property (it is not closed under addition), we conclude that <m>V</m> is <em>not</em> a subspace.  Indeed, it is the union of the two coordinate axes, which is not a span.

        We have to verify the three defining properties.  To say that a vector <m>v</m> is in <m>\Nul(A)</m> <em>means</em> that <m>Av = 0</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            The zero vector is in <m>\Nul(A)</m> because <m>A0=0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Suppose that <m>u,v</m> are in <m>\Nul(A)</m>.  This means that
            <m>Au=0</m> and <m>Av=0</m>.  Hence
            <me> A(u+v) = Au + Av = 0 + 0 = 0 </me>
            by the <xref ref="matrix-linearity">linearity of the matrix-vector product from</xref>.  Therefore, <m>u+v</m> is in <m>\Nul(A)</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Suppose that <m>v</m> is in <m>\Nul(A)</m> and <m>c</m> is a scalar.  Then
            <me>A(cv) = cAv = c\cdot 0 = 0</me>
            by the <xref ref="matrix-linearity">linearity of the matrix-vector product from</xref>, so <m>cv</m> is also in <m>\Nul(A)</m>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Since <m>\Nul(A)</m> satisfies the three defining properties of a subspace, it is a subspace.

      <solution>
        <p>
          The column space is the span of the columns of <m>A</m>:
          <me>\Col(A) = \Span\left\{\vec{1 1 1},\;\vec{1 1 1}\right\}
          = \Span\left\{\vec{1 1 1}\right\}.

        <p>
          The null space is the solution set of the homogeneous system <m>Ax=0</m>.  To compute this, we need to row reduce <m>A</m>.  Its reduced row echelon form is
          <me>\mat{1 1; 0 0; 0 0}.</me>
          This gives the equation <m>x+y=0</m>, or
          <me>\syseq{x = -y; y = y}
          \quad\xrightarrow{\text{parametric vector form}}\quad
          \vec{x y} = y\vec{-1 1}.
          </me>
          Hence the null space is <m>\Span\bigl\{{-1\choose 1}\bigr\}</m>, which is a line in <m>\R^2</m>.

          Notice that the column space is a subspace of <m>\R^3</m>, whereas the null space is a subspace of <m>\R^2</m>.  This is because <m>A</m> has three rows and two columns.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The column space and the null space of a matrix are both subspaces, so they are both spans.  The column space of a matrix <m>A</m> is defined to be the span of the columns of <m>A</m>.  The null space is defined to be the solution set of <m>Ax=0</m>, so this is a good example of a kind of subspace that we can define <em>without any spanning set in mind.</em>  In order to do computations, however, it is usually necessary to find a spanning set.
    </p>

    <warning>
      <p>
        To find a spanning set for <m>\Nul(A)</m>, compute the parametric vector form of the solutions to the homogeneous equation <m>Ax=0</m>.  The vectors attached to the free variables form a spanning set for <m>\Nul(A)</m>.
      </p>
    </warning>

    <example>
      <title>Two free variables</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Find a spanning set for the null space of the matrix
        <me>A = \mat{2 3 -8 -5; -1 2 -3 -8}.</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We compute the parametric vector form of the solutions of <m>Ax=0</m>.  The reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m> is
          <me>\mat{1 0 -1 2; 0 1 -2 -3}.</me>
          The free variables are <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_4</m>; the parametric form of the solution set is
          <me>
            \syseq{x_1 = x_3 - 2x_4; x_2 = 2x_3 + 3x_4; x_3 = x_3; x_4 = \. \+ x_4}
            \quad\xrightarrow{\text{parametric vector form}}\quad
            \vec{x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4} = x_3\vec{1 2 1 0} + x_4\vec{-2 3 0 1}.
          </me>
          Therefore,
          <me>\Nul(A) = \Span\left\{\vec{1 2 1 0},\;\vec{-2 3 0 1}\right\}.</me>
        </p>

      <title>No free variables</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Find a spanning set for the null space of the matrix

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We compute the parametric vector form of the solutions of <m>Ax=0</m>.  The reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m> is
          <me>\mat{1 0; 0 1}.</me>
          There are no free variables; hence the only solution of <m>Ax=0</m> is the trivial solution.  In other words,
          <me>\Nul(A) = \{0\} = \Span\{0\}.</me>

      <title>How do you know if a subset is a subspace?</title>
      <p>
        It is rarely necessary to verify the three properties of a subspace directly: most of the verifications were already done in this section.
        <ul>
          <li>Is your subset a span?  Can it be written as a span?</li>
          <li>Can it be written as the column space of a matrix?</li>
          <li>Can it be written as the null space of a matrix?  In other words, is it the solution set of a homogeneous system of equations?</li>
          <li>Is it all of <m>\R^n</m> or the zero subspace <m>\{0\}</m>?</li>
          <li>Can it be written as a type of subspace that we will see later (eigenspace, orthogonal complement, ...)?</li>
        </ul>
        If so, then it is automatically a subspace.
        If all else fails:
        <ul>
          <li>Can you verify directly that it satisfies the three defining properties of a subspace?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </warning>

    <example>
      <title>Verifying that a subset is a subspace, reprise</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let
          <me> V = \left\{ \vec{a b} \text{ in } \R^2 \bigm| 2a = 3b\right\}</me>
          be the subset of a previous <xref ref="subspaces-eg-byhand"/>. Verify that <m>V</m> is a subspace.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The subset <m>V</m> is exactly the solution set of the homogeneous equation <m>2x - 3y = 0</m>.  Hence it is the null space of the matrix <m>\mat{2 -3}</m>, so it is a subspace.
