		<statement>
			<p>[MIT OCW] You are given the nonsymmetric, diagonalizable matrix
				<me>A=\mat{-1 1 3;1 -3 -2;-1 0 -3}</me>
				and we want to understand the solutions of the ODE
				<me>\dfrac{dx}{dt} = Ax</me>
				for some initial condition <m>x(0)</m>.
				<ol>
					<li>Show (by any test you want, e.g. pivot test) that the matrix <me>A+A^H=\mat{-2 2 2;2 -6 -2;2 -2 -6}</me> is negative definite.</li>
					<li>If <m>Av=\lambda v</m> is an eigensolution of <m>A</m> (<m>v</m> and <m>\lambda</m> may be complex), look at <m>v^H(A + A^H)v</m> and use the fact that <m>A+A^H</m> is negative definite to show that the real part of <m>\lambda</m> must be negative.</li>
					<li>What can you conclude from the previous parts about the solutions <m>x(t)</m> as <m>t \to \inf</m>?</li>
					<li>If <m>A+A^H</m> is negative definite (so that <m>A</m>'s eigenvalues have negative real parts), but <m>A</m> is defective, does your answer to the previous part about <m>x(\inf)</m> change? Why or why not?</li>
