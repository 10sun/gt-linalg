1). A picture of a vector in R^3, drawn as an arrow, with dashed lines 
showing projections down to the x,y, z axes. 

2). A drag and drop vector in R^2 which has boxes displaying the angle and 
length of vector interactively. 

3). An example where there are three boxes, for R, G, and B which are RGB 
colors, where they can input 3 integers from 0,...,255. When they enter 
these three numbers, I had in mind that it would show a disk with the 
corresponding color, and also show the corresponding vector in R^3, drawn 
as an arrow. Or maybe you could have some kind of animation which follows 
some path in R^3, and there is a shaded disk or box whose color changes 
according to the corresponding RGB coordinates. 


- Start with a picture which is transformed by a linear transformation. Give a
few linear transformations to the students. They need to find the sequence that
transforms the picture to the undistorted shape.
