            <p>Forward elimination changes <m>Ax=b</m> to a row reduced <m>Rx=d</m>; the complete solution is

                    <li>
                        Since <m>R</m> is in reduced row echelon form, we must have
                        <me>
                            d=\vec{4 0 0}

                        The other two vectors provide special solutions for <m>R</m>, showing that <m>R</m> has a rank of 1: again, since it is in reduced row echelon form, the bottom two rows must be all 0, and top row is (1 -2 -5), i.e.,

                It is very important that we multiplied by <m>B\inv</m> on the same side in each equation, since matrix multiplication generally is not commutative. Had we multiplied by <m>B\inv</m> on the left for each side, we would have found <m>B\inv AB = C</m>.

            <p>State true or false: If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrices,then <m>A+B</m> is invertible and <m>(A+B)\inv = A\inv + B\inv</m>.</p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>False. <m>A + B</m> might not be invertible in the first place. For example, if <m>A = I_2</m> and <m>B = −I_2</m> then <m>A + B = 0</m> which is not invertible. Even in the case when <m>A + B</m> is invertible, it still might not be true that <m>(A + B)\inv = A\inv + B\inv</m>. For example, <m>(I_2 + I_2)\inv = (2I_2)\inv = \frac{1}{2}I_2</m>, whereas <m>(I_2)\inv + (I_2)\inv = I_2 + I_2 = 2I_2</m>.</p>
