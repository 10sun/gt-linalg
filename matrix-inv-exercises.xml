        <statement>
            <p>Forward elimination changes <m>Ax=b</m> to a row reduced <m>Rx=d</m>; the complete solution is
                <me>
                    x = \vec{4 0 0} + c_1\vec{2 1 0} + c_2\vec{5 0 1}
                </me>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is the 3 by 3 reduced row echelon matrix <m>R</m> and what is <m>d</m>?</li>
                    <li>If the process of elimination subtracted 3 times row 1 from row 2 and then 5 times row 1 from row 3, what matrix connects <m>R</m> and <m>d</m> to the original <m>A</m> and <m>b</m>? Use this matrix to find <m>A</m> and <m>b</m>.</li>

                    <li>
                        Since <m>R</m> is in reduced row echelon form, we must have
                        <me>
                            d=\vec{4 0 0}
                        </me>
                        The other two vectors provide special solutions for <m>R</m>, showing that <m>R</m> has a rank of 1: again, since it is in reduced row echelon form, the bottom two rows must be all 0, and top row is (1 -2 -5), i.e., 
                        <me>R=\mat{

                        The matrix connecting <m>R</m> and <m>d</m> to the original <m>A</m> and <m>b</m> is

            <p>Describe the most efficient way of how to test if an n Ã— n matrix is invertible, and how to compute <m>A\inv</m> via row operations. (Here n is large and <q>efficient</q> is measured in terms of the number of arithmetic operations).</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Suppose <m>A, B</m> are not square matrices, and <m>AB</m> is invertible (and thus <m>AB</m> is square). Why is the map <m>T</m> given by <m>T(x) = Bx</m> one-to-one? (Hint: multiply both sides of <m>Bx = 0</m> by <m>A</m> and use invertibility of <m>AB</m> to conclude that <m>x=0</m>). Why is the map <m>S</m> given by <m>S(x) = Ax</m> onto? (<m>Ax = b</m> is consistent: try <m>x = B(AB)\inv b</m> for a solution).</p>
