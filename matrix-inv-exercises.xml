        <statement>
            <p>Forward elimination changes <m>Ax=b</m> to a row reduced <m>Rx=d</m>: the complete solution is
                <me>
                    x = \vec{4 0 0} + c_1\vec{2 1 0} + c_2\vec{5 0 1}
                </me>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is the 3 by 3 reduced row echelon matrix <m>R</m> and what is <m>d</m>?</li>
                    <li>If the process of elimination subtracted 3 times row 1 from row 2 and then 5 times row 1 from row 3, what matrix connects <m>R</m> and <m>d</m> to the original <m>A</m> and <m>b</m>? Use this matrix to find <m>A</m> and <m>b</m>.</li>
                </ol>

        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Since <m>R</m> is in reduced row echelon form, we must have
                        <me>
                            d=\vec{4 0 0}
                        </me>
                        The other two vectors provide special solutions for <m>R</m>, showing that <m>R</m> has a rank of 1: again, since it is in reduced row echelon form, the bottom two rows must be all 0, and top row is (1 -2 -5), i.e., 
                        <me>R=\mat{
                            1 -2 -5;

                    <li>
                        The matrix connecting <m>R</m> and <m>d</m> to the original <m>A</m> and <m>b</m> is
                        <me>E = E_{31}E_{21} = \mat{
                             1 0 0;
                             0 1 0;
                            -5 0 1

                            -3 1 0;
                            0 0 1

                            1 0 0;
                            -3 1 0;
                            -5 1 0
                            }</me>
                        That is, <m>R=EA</m> and <m>Eb=d</m>.Thus <m>A=E\inv R</m> and <m>b=E\inv d</m>, giving
