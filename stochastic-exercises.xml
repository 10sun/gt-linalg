        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>P</m> be a stochastic <m>n \times n</m> matrix with positive entries. Give two methods of finding the steady state solution and discuss their computational efficiency. Give an example when <m>P</m> is stochastic, and does not have positive entries, but the steady state does not exist.</p>
