        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>P</m> be a stochastic <m>n \times n</m> matrix with positive entries. Give two methods of finding the steady state solution and discuss their computational efficiency. Give an example when <m>P</m> is stochastic, and does not have positive entries, but the steady state does not exist.</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be a positive stochastic matrix with steady state <m>w=\vec{1/3 2/3}</m>. What does <m>A^n \vec{9 0}</m> converge to as <m>n \to \infty</m>?</p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p><m>9w = \vec{3 6}</m>.</p>

        <statement>
            <p>A stochastic matrix admits a unique steady state.
                <ol>
                    <li>True</li>
                    <li>False</li>
                    <li>Maybe</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>Maybe. A positive stochastic matrix admits a unique steady state by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, but if the matrix has zero entries, then it may admit more than one steady state.</p>

            <p>In any given year, <m>10</m><percent/> of city dwellers will move to the country, while <m>90</m><percent/> will stay in the city. Likewise, <m>30</m><percent/> of country dwellers will move to the city, while <m>70</m><percent/> will stay in the country.
