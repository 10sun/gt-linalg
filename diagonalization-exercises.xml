            <p>Suppose you are given <m>n \times n</m> matrices <m>A</m> and <m>Q</m> such that <m>Q\inv AQ</m> is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries <m>d_1,\cdots,d_n</m>. Explain how to find the eigenvalues and a basis of eigenvectors for <m>A</m> without any computation.</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Give an example of a diagonalizable <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix that is not symmetric. (Hint: let <m>A = PDP\inv</m> where <m>P</m> is upper triangular but not diagonal, and <m>D</m> is diagonal. Then <m>A</m> would be also upper triangular, but probably not diagonal).</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix. Which of the following statements are equivalent to the statement that <m>A</m> is diagonalizable over the real numbers?
                <ol>
                    <li><m>A</m> is similar to a diagonal matrix.</li>
                    <li><m>A</m> has at least one eigenvector for each eigenvalue.</li>
                    <li>For each real eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> of <m>A</m>,the dimension of the <m>\lambda</m>-eigenspace is equal to the algebraic multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m>.</li>
                    <li><m>A</m> has <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors.</li>
                    <li><m>A</m> is invertible.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>1 and 4. A matrix by definition has at least one eigenvector for each eigenvalue. In option 3, a matrix need not have any real eigenvalues. Invertibility is unrelated to diagonalizability.</p>
