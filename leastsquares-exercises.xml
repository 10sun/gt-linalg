        <statement>
            <p>Explain step by step how to find the best fit line for a collection of <m>n</m> data points in <m>\R^2</m>. Why is the best fit line unique?</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix and <m>b</m> is a vector in <m>\R^n</m>. Explain how to use normal equations to find the least square solutions of <m>Ax=b</m>. For which <m>A</m> is the least square solution unique?</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be a <m>3 \times 2</m> matrix with orthogonal columns <m>v_1, v_2</m>. Explain why the least-squares solution to <m>Ax = b</m> is
                <me>\mat{\dfrac{b \cdot v_1}{v_1 \cdot v_1} ; \dfrac{b \cdot v_2}{v_2 \cdot v_2}} </me>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>The closest output vector is <m>\hat b = proj_{\Col A}(b)</m>. Since <m>v_1 \perp v_2</m>, we can directly compute
                <me>\hat b = \frac{b \cdot v_1}{v_1 \cdot v_1}v_1 + \frac{b \cdot v_2}{v_2 \cdot v_2}v_2 = A\vec{\frac{b \cdot v_1}{v_1 \cdot v_1} \frac{b \cdot v_2}{v_2 \cdot v_2}}</me>.
                But <m>\hat b = A \hat x</m>, so we must have
                <me>
                    \hat x = \vec{\frac{b \cdot v_1}{v_1 \cdot v_1} \frac{b \cdot v_2}{v_2 \cdot v_2}}

        <statement>
            <p>Suppose that your roomate Jamie is currently taking Math 1551. Jamie scored <m>72</m><percent/> on the first exam, <m>81</m><percent/> on the second exam, and <m>84</m><percent/> on the third exam. Not having taken linear algebra yet, Jamie does not know what kind of score to expect on the final exam. Luckily, you can help out.
                <ol>
                    <li>he general equation of a line in <m>\R^2</m> is <m>y = C + Dx</m>. Write down the system of linear equations in <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> that would be satisfied by a line passing through the points <m>(1,72), (2,81)</m>, and <m>(3,84)</m>, and then write down the corresponding matrix equation.</li>
                    <li>Solve the corresponding least squares problem for <m>C</m> and <m>D</m>, and use this to write down and draw the the best fit line.</li>
