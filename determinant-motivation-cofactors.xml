  <title>Determinants: First Examples and cofactor expansions </title>

	  <title>Motivation and first examples</title>
  <p>
    We begin by recalling three primary goals of this course:
  </p>

  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> Solving systems of linear equations, a.k.a. solving the matrix equation <m>Ax=b</m> (we've studied this problem in detail).</li>
      <li>Solving the matrix equation <m>Ax=\lambda x</m>, where <m>\lambda</m> is a number (the eigenvalue problem). We are currently studying this problem.</li>
      <li> "Almost solving" the matrix equation <m>Ax=b</m> (we will study this problem).</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>As we have seen that solving matrix equations <m>Ax=b</m> are much easier if we can find an inverse matrix <m>A^{-1}</m>, it is natural to ask for a numerical procedure to quickly test invertibility of matrices. It turns out that there is a very nice answer to this question, which is provided by the theory of <em>determinants</em>.
  </p>

  <p>Given any <em>square</em> <m>\ n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> (there is no such thing as a determinant for a non-square matrix!), the <term>determinant</term> of <m>A</m> is a number, called <m>\det A</m>. We will see several ways to describe this number.
  </p>

  <p>In fact, determinants are actually an instance of something you already know about: volume. Specifically, the <m>n</m> many columns of a square <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> are all <m>n</m>-dimensional vectors.
  These <m>n</m> vectors determine a parallelepiped in <m>\R^n</m>, which we will call the <em>parallelepiped for <m>A</m>.</em>
  For example, if <m>A</m> is a <m>2\times2</m> matrix whose columns are non-zero vectors <m>v</m> and <m>w</m>, that is, if <m>A=\spalignmat{v; w}</m>, then we have the parallelogram determined by <m>v</m> and <m>w</m>:

    Similarly, if <m>A</m> is a <m>3\times3</m> matrix, then we obtain three vectors in <m>\R^3</m>, which define a parallelepiped:

    <title>Key Observation</title>
    <p>
      The matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if the parallelepiped for <m>A</m> has non-zero volume, i.e., if and only if the parallelepiped is not "flat".
    </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <p>
    This is not too hard to believe, especially in low-dimensional cases.
    For example, if <m>A</m> is a <m>2\times2</m> matrix whose columns are non-zero vectors <m>v</m> and <m>w</m>, then we know that the matrix is invertible exactly when <m>v</m> and <m>w</m> are linearly independent, which happens exactly when they don't lie on the same line (neither is a scalar multiple of the other). But this occurs exactly when the parallelogram for <m>A</m> in <xref ref="PicPar2Vec"/> isn't "squashed."
  </p>

  <p>We shall later see that the determinant of <m>A</m> is a number associated
  to <m>A</m> whose absolute value <em>is</em> the volume of the parallelepiped
  for <m>A</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before jumping into general formulas for and the definition of the determinant, we consider a few examples. If <m>n=1</m>, then
    we know that a real number <m>a</m> is invertible (i.e., <m>1/a</m> makes sense) exactly when <m>a\neq0</m>. It is thus reasonable to define the determinant of the matrix <m>\spalignmat{a}</m> to simply be <m>a</m> itself. That is, for any real number <m>a</m>, we have
    <me>\det\mat{a}=a.</me>
    In this case, we can also think of <m>1</m>-dimensional "volume" as length, and the "parallelepiped for <m>A</m>" is just the vector <m>a</m> in <m>\R^1</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the case of a <m>2\times2</m> matrix <m> A=\mat{a b; c d}</m>, the explicit formula is
  <me>\det A =ad-bc.</me>
  It may seem that this formula has little to do with volume. However, it is a fun geometry problem to show that the parallelogram for <m>A</m> in <xref ref="PicPar2Vec"/> has area <m>|ad-bc|</m> (first think about the case when the first column of <m>A</m> lies on the <m>x</m>-axis). As another fun problem, one can perform row reduction directly on <m>A</m> to find that the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m> is the identity matrix <m>I_2</m> exactly when <m>ad-bc\neq0</m> (although we omit the calculation here).
  </p>

  <p>
  When <m>n=3</m>, the formula for the determinant is a little stranger:
  <me>\begin{split}
  &amp;
  \det\spalignmat{a_{11},a_{12},a_{13}; a_{21},a_{22},a_{23};a_{31},a_{32},a_{33}}
  \\
  &amp;
  \quad\quad
  =
  a_{11}a_{22}a_{33}+a_{12}a_{23}a_{31}+a_{13}a_{21}a_{32}
  -a_{13}a_{22}a_{31}-a_{11}a_{23}a_{32}-a_{12}a_{21}a_{33}.
  \end{split}
  </me>
  This formula looks too complicated to memorize outright. Fortunately, there is a useful mnemonic device for this formula, known as the <em>Rule of Sarrus</em>. This works by drawing a bigger matrix by recopying down the first two columns to the right of the matrix, and by drawing a series of upwards and downwards slashes as follows:

  Beoynd <m>n=3</m>, the formula for the determinant gets more complicated. In the subsequent sections, we will give several different ways for computing the determinant, we will apply them to give a general formula for the inverse of a matrix, and we will see how they can be thought of as stretch factors for linear transformations. That’s a lot to do, so let’s get going!

  <title>DCofactor expansions</title>

  <p>
    We begin by describing one formula for determinants. This definition may seem strange, and we will have to wait to see where it comes from and how it is connected to invertibility and volumes. However, it is convenient for calculations and will be enough to kick off our study of the determinant.
  </p>

  <p>We will build up this <em>cofactor expansion</em> from the ground up in a recursive procedure. Namely, this method will say how to compute the determinant for <m>n\times n</m> matrices, <em>assuming</em> we already know how to do so for <m>(n-1)\times(n-1)</m> matrices.
  </p>

  <p>Let's start at the beginning. First, we require determinants for <m>1\times1</m> matrices. As discussed in the last section, the natural definition of the determinant in this case, which is correct one, is
  <me>\det\mat a=a.</me>
  To give our general formula, we first need to introduce a little notation.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="Minor-Cofactors-Defn">
    <statement>
      <p>Suppose that <m>A</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>.
      </p>

      <p>The <m>(i,j)</m>-th <term>minor,</term> denoted <m>A_{ij}</m>, is the <m>(n-1)\times (n-1)</m> matrix obtained from <m>A</m> by deleting the <m>i</m>-th row and the <m>j</m>-th column.</p>

      <p>The <m>(i,j)</m>-th <term>cofactor </term>  <m>\ C_{ij}</m> is defined in terms of the minor by
      <me>C_{ij}=(-1)^{i+j}\det A_{ij}.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
  Note that the signs of the cofactors follow a "checkerboard pattern". Namely, the pattern of plus and minus signs in the <m>(i,j)</m>-th entry of the matrix
  <me>\def\a{\textcolor{seq-green}{+}} \def\b{\textcolor{seq-blue}{-}}
\mat{\a,\b,\a,\b ; \b,\a,\b,\a ; \a,\b,\a,\b; \b,\a,\b,\a}</me>

  <p>
    Using <xref ref="Minor-Cofactors-Defn"/>, we can describe our procedure for computing determinants as follows.
  </p>

  <algorithm>
    <title>Cofactor/Laplace expansion</title>
    <p>
      To compute the determinant of a square matrix, do the following.
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Choose any row or column of <m>A</m>.
	</li>
	<li> For each element <m>a_{ij}</m> of this row or column, compute the associated cofactor <m>C_{ij}</m>.</li>
	<li>
	  Multiply each cofactor by the associated matrix entry <m>a_{ij}</m>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <alert>Result:</alert>  The sum of these products is <m>\det A</m>.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </algorithm>

  <p>
    In formulas, this says that if we pick row <m>i</m> to "expand along," then the cofactor expansion formula is
    <me>\det A=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}C_{ij},</me>
    where in the sum the number <m>i</m> is fixed. Similarly, if we pick column <m>j</m> to expand along, then we obtain a formula
    <me>\det A=\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij}C_{ij}.</me>
    Note that this gives <m>2n</m> seemingly-different formulas, which all give the same number! We will see why this is true later, and simply assume this for now.

    They are all just single-entry matrices. As we have seen that the determinant of a <m>1\times1</m> matrix is just the number inside of it, the cofactors are therefore
    <md>
      <mrow>C_{11} &amp;= {+\det A_{11} = d} &amp;
      C_{12} &amp;= {-\det A_{12} = -c}</mrow>

    Choosing the first row of <m>A</m> in Step 1 of the cofactor expansion algorithm (when we do this, we also say that we are <em>expanding the determinant along the first row</em>), we find that

        The determinant is:
        <md>
          <mrow>\det A &amp;= a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + a_{13}C_{13}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp;= a_{11}\det\mat{a_{22} a_{23}; a_{32} a_{33}}
          - a_{12}\det\mat{a_{21} a_{23}; a_{31} a_{33}}
          + a_{13}\det\mat{a_{21} a_{22}; a_{31} a_{32}},
          </mrow>
        </md>
        which (magically) is the same formula as before.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    Here we perform the computation for a particular matrix.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>We find the determinant of
      <me>A= \mat{2 1 3;-1 2 1;-2 2 3}.</me>
      We make the somewhat arbitrary choice to expand along the first row. We compute the minors as
      <me> A_{11} = \mat{2 1;2 3} \quad\quad A_{12}=\mat{-1 1;2 3} \quad\quad  A_{13}=\mat{-1 2;-2 2}.</me>
      Computing these <m>2\times 2</m> determinants, we have
      <me>\det A_{11}=4,\quad\quad \det A_{12}=-1,\quad\quad \det A_{13}=2.</me>
      By inserting signs, we find that the cofactors are
      <me>C_{11}=\det A_{11}=4,\quad\quad C_{12}=-\det A_{12}=1,\quad\quad C_{13}=\det A_{13}=2.</me>
      Thus,
      <me>\det A=a_{11}C_{11}+a_{12}C_{12}+a_{13}C_{13} =2(4)+(1)+3(2)=15.</me>
    </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    With this method, much larger determinants are also easy to compute, especially when there are lots of zeros in a row or column. Generally speaking, it is a good idea when computing an example to try to expand along a row or column with as many zeros as possible, or at least with the smallest entries possible.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>We find the determinant of
      <me>A= \mat{2 5 -3 -2;-2 -3 2 -5;1 3 -2 0;-1 6 4 0}.</me>
      We expand along the last column to find
      <me>\det A=2\det\mat{-2 -3 2;1 3 -2;-1 6 4}
      -5 \det \mat{2 5 -3;1 3 -2;-1 6 4}.</me>
      We can find these two determinants by expanding them as well. For example, expanding along the first column on the first one, we find that
      <md>
        <mrow>
          &amp; \det \mat{-2 -3 2;1 3 -2;-1 6 4}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          &amp; = -2 \det \mat{3 -2;6 4} -\det \mat{-3 2;6 4} -\det \mat{-3 2;3 -2}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          &amp; = -2 (24) -(-24) -0=-48+24+0=-24.
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Similarly, by expanding the second <m>3\times 3</m> matrix along the first column, we find that
      <md>
        <mrow>
        &amp;
        \mat{2 5 -3;1 3 -2;-1 6 4}
        = 2 \det \mat{3 -2;6 4} -\det \mat{5 -3;6 4} -\det \mat{5 -3;3 -2}
        </mrow><mrow>
        &amp; = 2(24) -(38) -(-1) = 11.
      </mrow>
      </md>
      Thus, we find that
      <me>\det A= 2(-24)-5(11)=-103.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    Although this technique works reasonably quickly in most small examples, several important questions remain:

    <ol>
      <li>
	Where do these formulas come from?
      </li>
      <li>
	How do we know that these numbers give the same answer <em>regardless</em> of which row or column we choose (that is, this method gives <m>2n</m> different expressions for the same number attached to an <m>n\times n</m> matrix, which we claim are always all equal).
      </li>
      <li>
	Why does this number have to do with invertibility?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
