        <statement>
            <p>Explain why any orthonormal collection of vectors is linearly independent.</p>
        </statement>

    <exercise>
        <statement>
            <p>How does one compute the coordinates of a vector <m>v</m> in an orthonormal basis <m>u_1,\ldots,u_n</m>? Explain why this procedure is generally more efficient than finding coordinates in an non-orthonormal basis. (Caution: any vector in an orthonormal basis <m>u_1, \ldots, u_n</m> has length <m>1</m>, so in the formula for the <m>i</m>th coordinate of <m>v</m> you need not divide by <m>u_i \cdot u_i</m>)</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Every subspace of <m>\R^n</m> admits an orthogonal basis:

                    <li>True</li>
                    <li>False</li>

    <exercise>
        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be nonzero orthogonal vectors in <m>\R^n</m>. Which of the following are true?
                <ol>
                    <li><m>x \cdot y =0</m></li>
                    <li><m>\| x-y \|^2 = \|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2</m></li>
                    <li><m>proj_{\Span(x)}(y)=0</m></li>
                    <li><m>proj_{\Span(y)}(x)=0</m></li>

    <exercise>
    	<statement>
    		<p>[MIT OCW] What is the projection of the vector <m>\vec{1 1 1} \in \R^3</m> onto the plane <m>3x-4y+z=0</m>?</p>
    	</statement>
    	<answer>
    		<p>The vector <m>\vec{1 1 1}</m> lies on the plane <m>3x-4y+z=0</m>, so its projection onto that plane is simply <m>\vec{1 1 1}</m> again.</p>

    <exercise>
    	<statement>
    		<p>[MIT OCW] Suppose <m>\{v_1, \ldots, v_k\}</m> is an orthonormal set of vectors in <m>\R^n</m>. What happens when you apply Gram-Schmidt process to this set? Why?</p>
    	</statement>
    	<answer>
    		<p>The Gram-Schmidt procedure does not modify orthormal sets of vectors <m>\{v_1, ldots, v_k\}</m> in <m>\R^n</m>. Let us prove this statement by induction on <m>k</m>. If <m>k=1</m>, it is obvious. Consider an orthonormal set <m>\{v_1, \ldots, v_{k+1}\}</m> of <m>k+1</m> vectors in <m>\R^n</m>. We first apply GS to the set <m>\{v_1, \ldots, v_k\}</m>. By the induction 
    		hypothesis, this set stays unchanged. Then we compute to the orthogonal projection of <m>v_{k+1}</m> onto the space spanned by <m>v_1, ldots, v_k</m>. Since <m>v_{k+1}</m> is orthogonal to <m>v_i</m> for <m>i=1 \ldots k</m>, this projection is <m>0</m>. Therefore, GS procedure does not change the set <m>\{v_1, \ldots, v_{k+1}\}</m>.</p>
