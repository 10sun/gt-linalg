        <statement>
            <p>How does one compute the coordinates of a vector <m>v</m> in an orthonormal basis <m>u_1,\ldots,u_n</m>? Explain why this procedure is generally more efficient than finding coordinates in an non-orthonormal basis. (Caution: any vector in an orthonormal basis <m>u_1, \ldots, u_n</m> has length <m>1</m>, so in the formula for the <m>i</m>th coordinate of <m>v</m> you need not divide by <m>u_i \cdot u_i</m>)</p>
