        <statement>
            <p>Which of the following are subspaces of <m>\R^n</m>?
                <ol>
                    <li>The null space of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix.</li>
                    <li>An eigenspace of an <m>n \times n</m> matrix (for a particular eigenvalue).</li>
                    <li>The column space of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix.</li>
                    <li>The span of <m>n-1</m> vectors in <m>\R^n</m>.</li>
                    <li><m>W^\perp</m> where <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>1, 2, 4, and 5. The column space of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix is a subspace of <m>\R^m</m>, not <m>\R^n</m>. Any null space, eigenspace, perp space, or span is a subspace.</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Let
                <me>A=\mat{1 3 1 1; -1 -3 -4 2; 5 15 1 9}</me>
                <ol>
                    <li>What are <m>\dim(\Nul A)</m> and <m>\dim((\Nul A)_{\perp})</m>?</li>
                    <li>Find a basis for <m>(\Nul A)_{\perp}</m>.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Row reducing <m>A</m> yields:
                        <me>\mat{1 3 0 2; 0 0 1 -1;0 0 0 0}</me>
                        The variable <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_4</m> are free. The parametric form of the solution is:
                        <me>
                            \vec{x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4} = x_2\vec{-3 1 0 0} + x_4\vec{-2 0 1 1}
                        </me>
                        We can read off the null space from the parametric vector form; a basis is
                        <me>\bigl\{\vec{-3 1 0 0}, \vec{-2 0 1 1}\bigr\}</me>.
                        We can see that <m>\dim(\Nul A) = 2</m>. Since <m>\Nul A</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^4</m>, we have
                        <me>\dim((\Nul A)_{\perp})=4-\dim(\Nul A)=2.</me>
                    </li>
                    <li>Recall that <m>(\Nul A)_{\perp} = \Row A</m>. The first two rows of <m>A</m> are not multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent. We know already that <m>\dim((\Nul A)_{\perp}) = 2</m>, so the first two rows of <m>A</m> form a basis:
                        <me>\bigl\{\vec{1 3 1 1}, \vec{-1 -3 -4 2}\bigr\}</me>.
                    </li>
                </ol>

    	<statement>
    		<p>[MIT OCW] Why is each of these statements false?
    			<ol>
    				<li><m>\vec{1 1 1}</m> is perpendicular to <m>\vec{1 1 -2}</m> so the planes
 <m>x+y+z=0</m> and <m>x+y+2z=0</m> are the orthogonal subspaces.</li>
 					<li>The subspace spanned by <m>\vec{1 1 0 0 0}</m> and <m>\vec{0 0 0 1 1}</m> is the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by 
 					<m>\vec{1 -1 0 0 0}</m> and <m>\vec{2 -2 3 4 -4}</m>.</li>
 					<li>Two subspaces that meet only at the zero vector are orthogonal.</li>
    			</ol>
    		</p>
    	</statement>
    	<answer>
    		<p>
    			<ol>
    				<li>Two  planes  in  3D  can  not  be  orthogonal  to  each  other  as  the  sum  of  their
dimensions is greater than <m>3</m>.</li>
					<li>The first subspace is a <m>2</m>-dimensional subspace in a <m>5</m>-dimensional space. Its
orthogonal complement must be <m>3</m>-dimensional, so it can not be spanned by two vectors.</li>
					<li>For example, consider two lines <m>x=0</m> and <m>x+y=0</m> on the plane. These are
two lines that intersect at the zero vector, but they are not perpendicular to each other, so they are not orthogonal subspaces.</li>
