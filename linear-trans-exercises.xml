        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>T: \R^n\to\R^m</m> be a linear transformation with matrix <m>A</m>. Which of the following are equivalent to the statement that <m>T</m> is onto? 
                <ol>
                    <li><m>A</m> has a pivot in each row.</li>
                    <li>The columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.</li>
                    <li>If <m>T(v)=T(w)</m> then <m>v=w</m>.</li>
                    <li>For each input <m>v</m>, <m>T</m> there is exactly one output <m>T(v)</m>.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>1 only. Options 2 and 3 are equivalent to <m>T</m> being one-to-one, and option 4 is true for any transformation.</p>
