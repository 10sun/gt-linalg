                <statement>
                    <p>Suppose <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix. How many operations does solving <m>Ax=b</m> take (in the worst case scenario)?</p>

                <statement>
                    <p>Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix. Which of the following are equivalent to the statement that <m>A</m> is invertible?
                        <ol>
                            <li>The reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m> is the identity matrix.</li>
                            <li><m>A</m> is similar to the identity matrix.</li>
                            <li><m>A</m> is diagonalizable.</li>
                            <li>There is a matrix <m>B</m> such that <m>AB</m> is the identity matrix.</li>
                            <li><m>0</m> is not an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.</li>

                <answer>
                    <p>1, 4, and 5. The only matrix that is similar to the identity matrix is the identity matrix iself, and the zero matrix is diagonal(izable).</p>

                            <li><m>p=A\hat x</m> is the vector in <m>C(A)</m> nearest to a given vector <m>b</m>. If <m>A</m> has independent columns, what equation determines <m>\hat x</m>? What are all the vectors perpendicular to the error <m>e=b-A\hat x</m>? What goes wrong if the columns of <m>A</m> are dependent?</li>
                            <li>Suppose <m>A=QR</m> where <m>Q</m> has orthonormal columns and <m>R</m> is upper triangular invertible. Find <m>\hat x</m> and <m>p</m>.</li>
