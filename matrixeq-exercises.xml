		<statement>
			<p>[MIT OCW] A system of linear equations <m>Ax=b</m> cannot have exactly two solutions. An easy way to see why: if two vectors <m>x</m> and <m>y \ne x</m> are two solutions (i.e. <m>Ax=b</m>and <m>Ay=b</m>), what is another solution? (Hint: <m>x+y</m> is almost right.)
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p><m>Ax=b</m> and <m>Ay=b</m>, so <m>A(x+y)=Ax+Ay=2b</m>. [The key property that <m>A(x+y)=Ax+Ay</m> is called linearity, and is what makes matrix multiplication a part of linear algebra.] But we want <m>b</m> on the right-hand side, so we can just divide both sides by <m>2</m>: <m>A((x+y)/2)=b</m>, so <m>(x+y)/2</m> is a solution. (Since <m>x \ne y</m>, this is a new solution, halfway between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.)</p>
