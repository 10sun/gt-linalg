        <statement>
            <p>Explain how to compute <m>\det(A)</m> by cofactor expansion and by row operations. Which method is computationally better if <m>A</m> is <m>n \times n</m> and <m>n</m> is large? (Mention how many arithmetic operations it takes in the worst case).</p>

        <statement>
            <p>Compute the determinant of
                <me>A=\mat{4 0 0 5;1 7 2 -5;3 0 0 0;8 3 1 7}</me>
                using cofactor expansions. Expand along the rows or columns that require the least amount of work.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>The expand along the third row because it only has one nonzero entry.
                <md>
                    <mrow>\det(A)=3(-1)^{3+1}.\det \mat{0 0 5;7 2 -5; 3 1 7}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\quad =3 \cdot 5(-1)^{1+3}\det \mat{7 2;3 1}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\quad = 3(5)(1)(7-6) = 15</mrow>
                </md>.
                (In the second step, we used the cofactor expansion along the first row since it had only one nonzero entry.)

        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
                <ol>
                    <li>Using cofactor expansion, explain why <m>\det(A) = 0</m> if <m>A</m> has a row or a column of zeros.</li>
                    <li>Using cofactor expansion, explain why <m>\det(A) = 0</m> if <m>A</m> has adjacent identical columns.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If <m>A</m> has zeros for all entries in row <m>i</m> (so <m>a_{i1} = a_{i2} =···= a_{in} =0</m>),then the cofactor expansion along row <m>i</m> is
                        <me>\det(A) = a_{i1}C_{i1} +a_{i2}C_{i2} +···+a_{in}C_{in} = 0 \cdot C_{i1} +0 \cdot C_{i2} +···+0 \cdot C_{in} =0.</me>
                        Similarly, if <m>A</m> has zeros for all entries in column <m>j</m>, then the cofactor expansion along column <m>j</m> is the sum of a bunch of zeros and is thus <m>0</m>.
                    </li>
                    <li>If <m>A</m> has identical adjacent columns, then the cofactor expansions will be identical, except the signs of the cofactors will be opposite (due to the <m>(−1)^{power}</m> factors).
                        Therefore, <m>\det(A) = -\det(A)</m>, so <m>\det(A) = 0</m>.

    	<statement>
    		<p>[MIT OCW] For any invertible matrix <m>A</m>, the <m>(1, 1)</m> entry of <m>A\inv</m> is the ratio of <fillin/>. So the <m>(1, 1)</m> entry of <m>A_4\inv</m> is <fillin/>.</p>
    	</statement>
    	<answer>
    		<p>Cramer's rule gives <m>A\inv = \dfrac{1}{|A|}C^T</m> where <m>C</m> is the cofactor matrix, whose <m>(i, j)</m> entry is 
    		<m>(-1)^{i+j}|M_{ij}|</m> where <m>M_{ij}</m> is the submatrix obtained by deleting row <m>i</m> and column <m>j</m> of the (arbitrary) invertible matrix <m>A</m>.
    		 Thus the entry with <m>i=j=1</m> is <m>|M_{11}|/|A|</m>.
    		 </p>
    		 <p>In the case where <m>A=A_n</m>, the submatrix <m>M_{11}</m> is <m>A_{n-1}</m>; so the desired formula is <m>|A_{n-1}|/|A_n|</m>.
    		 Now, <m>|A_n|=1-n</m> by part(a). So <m>|A_4|=-3</m> and <m>|A_3|=-2</m>. Thus the <m>(1, 1)</m> entry of <m>A_4\inv</m> is <m>2/3</m>.
