          This is a homogeneous system of equations, and it has infinitely many solutions.

        <p>Note that simply writing down the three scalars, and demonstrating that they provide a nontrivial relation of linear dependence on <m>T</m>, could be considered an ironclad solution.

          By the familiar methods, you can check that this homogeneous system of linear equations admits only the trivial solution <m>a_1=a_2=a_3=0</m>, as desired.
