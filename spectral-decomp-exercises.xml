            <p>Explain step by step how to find the spectral decomposition <m>\sum_{i=1}^r \sigma_i u_i {v_i}^T</m>for an <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>.</p>

            <p>Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix of rank <m>r</m>. If <m>r</m> is much smaller, than <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>, explain how the spectral decomposition is an efficient way to store <m>A</m>(this is called data compression).</p>
