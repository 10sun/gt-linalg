        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be a <m>5 \times 3</m> matrix. Suppose that <m>\Nul(A)</m>is a line. What is the range of the transformation <m>T(x) = Ax</m>?
                <ol>
                    <li>A line in <m>\R^3</m>.</li>
                    <li>A plane in <m>\R^3</m>.</li>
                    <li>A line in <m>\R^5</m>.</li>
                    <li>A plane in <m>\R^5</m>.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>4. The codomain of <m>T</m> is <m>\R^5</m>, because <m>A</m> has five rows. By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, the rank of <m>A</m> is <m>3-1=2</m>, the number of columns minus the dimension of <m>\Nul(A)</m>. Therefore, the rank of <m>A</m> is <m>2</m>, so the column space of <m>A</m> is a plane in <m>\R^5</m>. The range of <m>T</m> is the column space of <m>A</m>.</p>
