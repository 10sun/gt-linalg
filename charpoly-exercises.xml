        <statement>
            <p>Real eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are defined as the real numbers <m>\lambda</m> such that <m>(A-\lambda I_n)x = 0</m> has a nonzero real solution <m>x</m>. Explain why eigenvalues are precisely the real roots of <m>\det(A-\lambda I_n)</m>, the characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m>. What do nonreal roots of <m>\det(A-\lambda I_n)</m> correspond to?</p>

            <p>Why do eigenvalues of a triangular matrix <m>(a_{ij})</m> are its entries on the main diagonal, that is, <m>a_{11}, \cdots , a_{nn}</m>? Is this true for non-triangular matrix?</p>
