                <statement>
                    <p>Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers, with <m>b \gt 0</m>.  Then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
                        <me>a = bq + r</me>
                    where <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m>.</p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>This is a perfect example of the existence-and-uniqueness type of proof.  We must first prove that the numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> actually  exist. Then we must show that if  <m>q'</m> and <m>r'</m> are two other such numbers, then <m>q = q'</m> and <m>r = r'</m>.</p>

                    <p><em>Existence of <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>.</em> Let
                        <me>S = \{ a - bk : k \in {\mathbf Z} \text{ and } a - bk \geq 0 \}.</me>
                    If <m>0 \in S</m>, then <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>, and  we can let <m>q = a/b</m> and <m>r = 0</m>.  If <m>0 \notin S</m>, we can use the Well-Ordering Principle.  We must first show that <m>S</m> is nonempty.  If <m>a \gt 0</m>, then <m>a - b \cdot 0 \in S</m>. If <m>a \lt 0</m>, then <m>a - b(2a) = a(1 - 2b) \in S</m>.  In either case <m>S \neq \emptyset</m>.  By the Well-Ordering Principle, <m>S</m> must have a smallest member, say <m>r = a - bq</m>. Therefore, <m>a = bq + r</m>, <m>r \geq 0</m>. We now show that <m>r \lt b</m>. Suppose that <m>r \gt b</m>. Then
                        <me>a - b(q + 1)= a - bq - b = r - b \gt 0.</me>
                    In this case we would have <m>a - b(q + 1)</m> in the set <m>S</m>. But then <m>a - b(q + 1) \lt a - bq</m>, which would contradict the fact that <m>r = a - bq</m> is the smallest member  of <m>S</m>. So <m>r \leq b</m>.  Since <m>0 \notin S</m>, <m>r \neq b</m> and so <m>r \lt b</m>.</p>

                    <p><em>Uniqueness of <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>.</em> Suppose there exist integers <m>r</m>, <m>r'</m>, <m>q</m>, and <m>q'</m> such that
                        <me>a = bq + r, 0 \leq r \lt b \quad \text{and}\quad a = bq' + r', 0 \leq r' \lt b.</me>
                    Then <m> bq + r =  bq' + r'</m>.  Assume that <m>r' \geq r</m>.  From the last equation we have <m>b(q - q') = r' - r</m>; therefore, <m>b</m> must divide <m>r' - r</m> and <m>0 \leq r'- r \leq r' \lt b</m>.  This is possible only if <m>r' - r = 0</m>.  Hence, <m>r = r'</m> and  <m>q = q'</m>.</p>

        </introduction>

        <subsection>
            <title>The Euclidean Algorithm</title>

            <p>Among other things, <xref ref="theorem-integers-gcd" /> allows us to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers.</p>

            <example xml:id="example-integers-gcd">
                <p>Let us compute the greatest common divisor of <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>.  First observe that<md>
                    <mrow>2415 &amp; = 945 \cdot 2 + 525</mrow>
                    <mrow>945 &amp; = 525 \cdot 1 + 420</mrow>
                    <mrow>525 &amp; = 420 \cdot 1 + 105</mrow>
                    <mrow>420 &amp; = 105 \cdot 4 + 0.</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>Reversing our steps, 105 divides 420, 105 divides 525, 105 divides 945, and 105 divides 2415.  Hence, 105 divides both 945 and 2415.  If <m>d</m> were another common divisor of 945 and 2415, then <m>d</m> would also have to divide 105.  Therefore, <m>\gcd( 945, 2415 ) = 105</m>.</p>

                <p>If we work backward through the above sequence of equations, we can also obtain numbers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>945 r + 2415 s = 105</m>.  Observe that<md>
                    <mrow>105 &amp; = 525 + (-1) \cdot 420</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = 525 + (-1) \cdot [945 + (-1) \cdot 525]</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot 525 + (-1) \cdot 945</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot [2415 + (-2) \cdot 945] + (-1) \cdot 945</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot 2415 + (-5) \cdot 945.</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>So <m>r = -5</m> and <m>s= 2</m>.  Notice that <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are not unique, since <m>r = 41</m> and <m>s = -16</m> would also work.</p>
            </example>

            <p>To compute <m>\gcd(a,b) = d</m>, we are using repeated divisions to obtain a decreasing sequence of positive integers <m>r_1 \gt r_2 \gt \cdots \gt r_n = d</m>; that is,<md>
                <mrow>b &amp; = a q_1 + r_1</mrow>
                <mrow>a &amp; = r_1 q_2 + r_2</mrow>
                <mrow>r_1 &amp; = r_2 q_3 + r_3</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; \vdots </mrow>
                <mrow>r_{n - 2} &amp; = r_{n - 1} q_{n} + r_{n}</mrow>
                <mrow>r_{n - 1} &amp; = r_n q_{n + 1}.</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>To find <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>ar + bs = d</m>, we begin with this last equation and substitute results obtained from the previous equations:<md>
                <mrow>d &amp; = r_n</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = r_{n - 2} - r_{n - 1} q_n</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = r_{n - 2} - q_n( r_{n - 3} - q_{n - 1} r_{n - 2} )</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = -q_n r_{n - 3} + ( 1+ q_n q_{n-1} ) r_{n - 2} </mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; \vdots </mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = ra + sb.</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>The algorithm that we have just used to find the greatest common divisor <m>d</m> of two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and to write <m>d</m> as the linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is known as the <term>Euclidean algorithm</term><idx><h>Euclidean algorithm</h></idx><idx><h>Algorithm</h><h>Euclidean</h></idx>.</p>

            <title>Prime Numbers</title>

            <p>Let <m>p</m> be an integer such that <m>p \gt 1</m>.  We say that <m>p</m> is a <term>prime number</term><idx><h>Prime integer</h></idx>, or simply <m>p</m> is <term>prime</term>, if the only positive numbers that divide <m>p</m> are 1 and <m>p</m> itself.

                    <p>We will prove this theorem by contradiction.  Suppose that there are only a finite number of primes, say <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n</m>.  Let <m>P = p_1  p_2  \cdots  p_n + 1</m>.    Then <m>P</m> must be divisible by some <m>p_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>.

                    <p><em>Uniqueness.</em>  To show uniqueness we will use induction on <m>n</m>. The theorem is certainly true for <m>n = 2</m> since in this case <m>n</m> is prime.  Now assume that the result holds for all integers <m>m</m> such that <m>1 \leq m \lt n</m>, and

Since all of the <m>p_i</m>'s and <m>q_i</m>'s are prime, <m>p_1 = q_i</m> and  <m>q_1 = p_j</m>. Hence, <m>p_1 = q_1</m> since <m>p_1 \leq p_j = q_1 \leq q_i = p_1</m>.  By the induction hypothesis,

                    has a unique factorization.  Hence, <m>k = l</m> and <m>q_i = p_i</m> for <m>i = 1, \ldots, k</m>.</p>

        <subsection>
            <title>Historical Note</title>

            <p>Prime numbers were first studied by the ancient Greeks.  Two important results from antiquity are Euclid's proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer <m>n</m>.  One problem in number theory is to find a function <m>f</m> such that <m>f(n)</m> is prime for each integer <m>n</m>. Pierre Fermat (1601?<ndash />1665) conjectured that <m>2^{2^n} + 1</m> was prime for all <m>n</m>, but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707<ndash />1783) that
                <me>2^{2^5} + 1 = \text{4,294,967,297}</me>
            is a composite number. One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach's Conjecture.  In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of 2 seemed to be the sum of two primes:  <m>4 = 2 + 2</m>, <m>6 = 3 + 3</m>, <m>8 =3 + 5</m>, <m>\ldots</m>.  Although the conjecture has been verified for the numbers up through <m>4 \times 10^{18}</m>, it has yet to be proven in general.  Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography, there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.</p>
