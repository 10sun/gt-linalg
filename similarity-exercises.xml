      <statement>
        <p>Find a matrix that is similar to the matrix
          <me>A=\mat{1 2;3 4}</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>If we take any invertible <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix <m>P</m> and define <m>B=P\inv AP</m>, then <m>B</m> will be similar to <m>A</m>.
          For example, let's take
          <me>P=\mat{-8 3;5 -2}</me>
          and then let
          <md>
            <mrow>
              B=P\inv AP
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \quad=\mat{-2 -3;-5 -8}\mat{1 2; 3 4}\mat{-8 3;5 -2}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \quad=\mat{8 -1;22 -3}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          It is quite obvious that there are infinitely many matrices that are similar to <m>A</m> because we could perform this procedure using any
invertible matrix <m>P</m>.

        <p>[MIT OCW] Why are these statements all true?
          <ol>
            <li>If <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m> then <m>A^2</m> is similar to <m>B^2</m>.</li>
            <li><m>A^2</m> and <m>B^2</m> can be similar when <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not similar (try <m>\lambda = 0,0</m>).</li>
            <li><m>\mat{3 0;0 4}</m> is similar to <m>\mat{3 1;0 4}</m>.</li>
            <li><m>\mat{3 0; 0 3}</m> is not similar to <m>\mat{3 1;0 3}</m>.</li>
            <li>Given a matrix <m>A</m>, let <m>B</m> be the matrix obtained by exchanging rows 1 and 2 of <m>A</m> and then exchanging columns 1 and 2 of <m>A</m>. <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>If <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, then:
              <me>A=M\inv BM \implies A^2=M\inv BM(M\inv BM) = M\inv B^2 M</me>.
              Since <m>A^2=M\inv BM</m>, by definition <m>A^2</m> is similar to <m>B^2</m>.
            </li>
            <li>Let:
              <me>A=\mat{0 0; 0 0} \text{ and } B=\mat{0 1; 0 0}</me>
              Then <m>A^2</m> is similar to <m>B^2</m>, but <m>A</m> is not similar to <m>B</m> because nothing but the zero matrix is similar to the zero matrix.
            </li>
            <li>
              There  are  multiple ways to verify that the given matrices are  similar. One way is to explicitly find the matrix <m>M</m> that satisfies the similarity condition:
              <me>\mat{3 0;0 4}=\mat{1 -1; 0 1}\mat{3 1; 0 4}\mat{1 1; 0 1}</me>.
            </li>
            <li>The given matrices are  not similar because for the first matrix every vector in the plane is an eigenvector for <m>\lambda=3</m>, whereas the second matrix only has a line (<m>y=0</m>) of eigenvectors
            corresponding to <m>\lambda=3</m>. We know that similar matrices have the same number of independent eigenvectors, so the given matrices cannot be similar. </li>
            <li>To exchange the first two rows of <m>A</m>, we multiply <m>A</m> on the left by:
              <me>M=\mat{0 1 0 0;1 0 0 0;0 0 1 0;0 0 0 1}</me>
              In order to exchange the first two columns of <m>A</m>, we multiply it on the right by the same matrix <m>M</m>. We thus have <m>B=MAM</m>. Since <m>M\inv = M</m>, <m>B</m> is similar to <m>A</m>.

    		<p>[MIT OCW] Let <m>B</m> be an invertible matrix, such that <m>C=B\inv AB</m>. <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> are similar matrices. Show that the converse is false, i.e., if <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> have same eigen values  then there may not

    		<p>[MIT OCW] We say that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar matrices if <m>A=SBS\inv</m> for some invertible matrix <m>S</m>. Are the following TRUE or FALSE? Give a reason:
    			<ol>
    				<li>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar, then <m>A-5I</m> and <m>B-5I</m> are similar.</li>
    				<li>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar, then <m>A^T</m> and <m>B^T</m> are similar.</li>
    				<li>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar, then <m>AB</m> and <m>BA</m> are similar.</li>
    			</ol>
    		</p>
    	</statement>
    	<answer>
    		<p>
    			<ol>
    				<li>True.
    					<me>A-5I = SBS\inv - 5I = S(B-5I)S\inv</me>
    				</li>
    				<li>
    					True.
    					<me>A = SBS\inv</me>
    					So, <me>A^T = (S\inv)^T B^T S^T = (S^T)\inv B^T S^T</me>
    				</li>
    				<li>
    					True.
    					<me>A=SBS\inv \implies AS = SB</me>
    					<me>S(BA)S\inv = (SB)AS\inv = ASAS\inv = AB</me>
