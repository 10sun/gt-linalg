      <statement>
        <p>Find a matrix that is similar to the matrix
          <me>A=\mat{1 2;3 4}</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>If we take any invertible <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix <m>P</m> and define <m>B=P\inv AP</m>, then <m>B</m> will be similar to <m>A</m>.
          For example, let's take
          <me>P=\mat{-8 3;5 -2}</me>
          and then let
          <md>
            <mrow>
              B=P\inv AP
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \quad=\mat{-2 -3;-5 -8}\mat{1 2; 3 4}\mat{-8 3;5 -2}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \quad=\mat{8 -1;22 -3}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          It is quite obvious that there are infinitely many matrices that are similar to <m>A</m> because we could perform this procedure using any
invertible matrix <m>P</m>.

            <p>If <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>, and <m>B</m> is similar to <m>C</m>, are <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> also similar? If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar, are <m>A^k</m> and <m>B^k</m> also similar?</p>

    	<statement>
    		<p>[MIT OCW] Let <m>B</m> be an invertible matrix, such that <m>C=B\inv AB</m>. <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> are similar matrices. Show that the converse is false, i.e., if <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> have same eigen values  then there may not
be a matrix <m>B</m> such that <m>C=B\inv AB</m>.

    	<statement>
    		<p>[MIT OCW] We say that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar matrices if <m>A=SBS\inv</m> for some invertible matrix <m>S</m>. Are the following TRUE or FALSE? Give a reason:
    			<ol>
    				<li>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar, then <m>A-5I</m> and <m>B-5I</m> are similar.</li>
    				<li>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar, then <m>A^T</m> and <m>B^T</m> are similar.</li>
    				<li>If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar, then <m>AB</m> and <m>BA</m> are similar.</li>
    			</ol>
    		</p>
    	</statement>
    	<answer>
    		<p>
    			<ol>
    				<li>True.
    					<me>A-5I = SBS\inv - 5I = S(B-5I)S\inv</me>
    				</li>
    				<li>
    					True.
    					<me>A = SBS\inv</me>
    					So, <me>A^T = (S\inv)^T B^T S^T = (S^T)\inv B^T S^T</me>
    				</li>
    				<li>
    					True.
    					<me>A=SBS\inv \implies AS = SB</me>
    					<me>S(BA)S\inv = (SB)AS\inv = ASAS\inv = AB</me>
    				</li>
    			</ol>
