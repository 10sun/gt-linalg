	            <li>False.

					<li>Yes, by inspection the given equation results from subtracting the first equation  from the second.</li>
					<li>No. The pair <m>(1,1)</m> satisfies the given equation (which can of course be checked directly, but to find this, the student is recommended to draw a picture). However, that pair does not satisfy the first equation in the system.</li>
					<li>Yes. To see if the given equation results from taking <m>c_1</m> times the first equation and adding it to <m>c_2</m> times the second, we  solve the system of equations relating the coefficients of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>, and these constants:
						<me>
							\syseq{
							2c_1  +  6c_2  =  6; 
                						c_1  -  3c_2  =  -9 ;
               						-c_1  +  c_2   =  5;  
               						4c_1  +  5c_2  =  -2,
							}
						</me>
						 and get <m>c_1=-3</m> and <m>c_2=2</m>, so the given equation is obtained as the <em>linear combination</em> of <m>-3</m> times the first equation plus twice the second equation.

			<p>A comparison of the units and hundreds columns of this addition shows that there must be a carry from the tens column. The tens column then tells us that <m>A</m><less/><m>H</m>, so there can be no carry from the units or hundreds columns. The five columns then give the following five equations.

		<statement>
			<p>(The Wohascum County Problem Book problem number 2.) The Wohascum County Board of Commissioners, which has 20 members, recently had to elect a President. There were three candidates (<m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>); on each ballot the three candidates were to be listed in order of preference, with no abstentions. It was found that 11 members, a majority, preferred <m>A</m> over <m>B</m> (thus the other 9 preferred <m>B</m> over <m>A</m>). Similarly, it was found that 12 members preferred <m>C</m> over <m>A</m>. Given these results, it was suggested that <m>B</m> should withdraw, to enable a runoff election between <m>A</m> and <m>C</m>. However, <m>B</m> protested, and it was then found that 14 members preferred <m>B</m> over <m>C</m>! The Board has not yet recovered from the resulting confusion. Given that every possible order of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m> appeared on at least one ballot, how many members voted for <m>B</m> as their first choice?</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>Eight commissioners voted for <m>B</m>. To see this, we will use the given information to study how many voters chose each order of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>.</p>
			<p>The six orders of preference are <m>ABC</m>, <m>ACB</m>, <m>BAC</m>, <m>BCA</m>, <m>CAB</m>, <m>CBA</m>; assume they receive <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, <m>d</m>, <m>e</m>, <m>f</m> votes respectively.</p>
			<p>We know that
				<me>
					\syseq{
					 a  +  b  +  e  =  11;  
           					d  +  e  +  f  =  12;
           					a  +  c  +  d  =  14
					}
				</me>
				rom the number preferring <m>A</m> over <m>B</m>, the number preferring <m>C</m> over <m>A</m>, and the number preferring <m>B</m> over <m>C</m>.
			</p>
			<p>Because 20 votes were cast, <m>a+b+\cdots+f=20</m>. Subtracting the sum of the three above equations from twice the prior equation gives <m>b+c+f=3</m>. We've specified that each preference order got at  least one vote, so that means <m>b=c=f=1</m>. </p>
			<p>From the above three equations the complete solution is then <m>a=6</m>, <m>b=1</m>, <m>c=1</m>, <m>d=7</m>, <m>e=4</m>, and <m>f=1</m>, as we can find with Row reduction. The number of commissioners voting for <m>B</m> as their first choice is therefore <m>c+d=1+7=8</m>.</p>
			<p><em>Comments:</em> The answer to this question would have been the same had we known only
       that <em>at least</em>14 commissioners preferred <m>B</m> over <m>C</m>. The seemingly paradoxical nature of the commissioner's preferences (<m>A</m> is preferred to <m>B</m>, and <m>B</m> is preferred to <m>C</m>, and <m>C</m> is preferred to <m>A</m>), an example of <q>non-transitive dominance</q>, is common when individual choices are pooled.</p>
