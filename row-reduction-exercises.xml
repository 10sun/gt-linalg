	          <li>A system of 5 linear equations can have exactly 5 solutions.</li>
                  <!-- JDR: matrix equations don't happen until 3.3 -->
	          <!-- <li>Any line in <m>\R^3</m> can be the solution set of a matrix equation of the form <m>Ax=0</m> for some <m>3\times3</m> matrix.</li> -->

	          <li>
	            There is a unique matrix having reduced row echelon form.

	      </statement>
	      <answer>
	        <p><ol>
	            <li>False. The solution set to any system of linear equations is either empty (inconsistent equations), has a unique solution (consistent equations, no free variables), or infinite (if there is a free variable, since this free variable can then take on the value of any of the infinitely many real numbers).</li>
	            <!-- <li>False. The vector <m>x=0</m> automatically solves this equation, so any solution set of such an equation must contain the origin.</li> -->
	            <li>True. There is one free variable.</li>
	            <li>False. Although any matrix has a unique reduced row echelon form, a given matrix in reduced form could be the reduction of many possible matrices.
	              </li>
	            <!-- <li>True. After forming the corresponding augmented matrix and row reducing, the values of each of the variables will be completely determined by the initial variables. The equation may then have either no solutions or one solution, depending on the values of the transformed vector <m>b</m> corresponding to the rows of <m>0</m>'s in the RREF of <m>A</m>.</li> -->

		<answer>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>We add <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m> times the first row to the second to find
						<me>
							\amat{
							     2   2  5;
	              					     0 -5  -\frac{5}{2}
							}
						</me>
					which shows that <m>y = \frac{1}{2}</m>  and <m>x = 2</m> is the solution.
					</li>
					<li>Row reduction algorithm says that we should add the first and second rows to get:
						<me>
							\amat{
							-1   1   1;
	                 					0   2   3
							}
						</me>
       					 giving <m>y = \frac{3}{2}</m> and <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m> as the solution.
					</li>
					<li>Interchanging the first and fourth rows gives
						<me>
							\amat{

                   						0   4  1 20

						</me>
					Now subtracting the first row from the third and adding <m>-2</m> times the first row to the second row yields
						<me>
							\amat{

                   						 0   4  1  20
							}
						</me>
					Finally, we add the second and fourth rows and subtract <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> times the second row from the third row to obtain
						<me>
							\amat{
							  1  1 -1  10;
                  						 0   -4  3  -20;
                  						 0   0    \frac{5}{4}  0;
                  						 0  0   4  0

		<statement>
			<p>This system is not linear in that it says <m>\sin\alpha</m> instead of <m>\alpha</m>
				<me>
					\syseq{
					2\sin\alpha -  \cos\beta  +  3\tan\gamma  =  3;  
         					4\sin\alpha  +  2\cos\beta -  2\tan\gamma  =  10;  
         					6\sin\alpha  -  3\cos\beta +  \tan\gamma   =  9  
					}
				</me>
				 and yet we can apply Row Reduction, as it is linear in the parameters <m>\sin\alpha</m>, <m>\cos\beta</m>, <m>\tan\gamma</m>. Do so. Does the system have a solution?
			</p>

				gives <m>z=0</m>, <m>y=1</m>, and <m>x=2</m>. Note that no <m>\alpha</m> satisfies that requirement.

		<statement>
			<p>Note that multiplying an equation by <m>0</m> is not allowed in Row reduction because that could change a solution set. Give an example of a system with solution set <m>S_0</m> where after multiplying a row by <m>0</m> the new system has a solution set <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_0</m> is a proper subset of <m>S_1</m>, that is, <m>S_0 \neq S_1</m>. Give an example where <m>S_0=S_1</m>. </p>

			<p>Row reduction works by combining the equations in a system to make new equations.</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Can we derive the equation <m>3x-2y=5</m> by a sequence of row reduction steps from the equations in this system?
						<me>
							\syseq{

            						4x  -  y  =  6

					<li>Can we derive the equation <m>5x-3y=2</m> with a sequence of row reduction steps from the equations in this system?
						<me>
							\syseq{

            						3x  +  y  =  4
							}
						</me>
					</li>
					<li>Can we derive <m>6x-9y+5z=-2</m> by a sequence of row reduction steps from the equations in the system?
						<me>
							\syseq{

				<ol>
					<li>Yes, by inspection the given equation results from subtracting the first equation  from the second.</li>
					<li>No. The pair <m>(1,1)</m> satisfies the given equation (which can of course be checked directly, but to find this, the student is recommended to draw a picture). However, that pair does not satisfy the first equation in the system.</li>
					<li>Yes. To see if the given equation results from taking <m>c_1</m> times the first equation and adding it to <m>c_2</m> times the second, we  solve the system of equations relating the coefficients of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>, and these constants:
						<me>
							\syseq{
							2c_1  +  6c_2  =  6; 
                						c_1  -  3c_2  =  -9 ;
               						-c_1  +  c_2   =  5;  
               						4c_1  +  5c_2  =  -2,
							}
						</me>
						 and get <m>c_1=-3</m> and <m>c_2=2</m>, so the given equation is obtained as the <em>linear combination</em> of <m>-3</m> times the first equation plus twice the second equation.
